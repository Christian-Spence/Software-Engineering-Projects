| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [My Very Own Coffee Shop ☕ (Spence's Coffee Shop)](https://github.com/Christian-Spence/se_project_coffeeshop.git)| This is a project of mine where I engineered a website for a coffee shop. The coffee shop has imported videos helping other people create recipes at home, a booking form so people can book a table to visit the store location in person, a menu showing the cost of my products, information about the shop, and social media links. <br> It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript based on the design brief. 
| 2 | [Social Media App (Spots)](https://github.com/Christian-Spence/se_project_spots.git)| Spots is an interactive social media web application. Users can add and remove photos, like other users' photos, and make minor adjustments to their profile. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
